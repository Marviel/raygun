# TODOs

Looking for inspiration? Here are some ideas for things that still could be done.

* Cleanup/refactor raygun code (a few simple helpers would help out a whole lot)
* Registration flow (simple)
* Change password flow
* Add the concept of an admin / super user
* Invite user flow
* Use cancan to restrict access to /users to an admin
* Use cancan to allow users to edit only themselves and admins to edit any user
* Continue to improve bootstrap view templates
* CSS/less best practices for file organization
* JS/coffeescript best practices
* Add pagination to the default index scaffold (kaminari)
* JS testing
* Use foreigner for database constraints
* Fast tests best practices
* Use guard (rspec, livereload, js testing, etc)
* Paperclip + S3 configuration
* Application monitoring
* Analytics
* One step configuration for Heroku (production and acceptance)
* One step configuration on CI
